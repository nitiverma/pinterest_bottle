Assumptions
-----------

# Create board assumes that the isLogin function is already present which will verify if the user is logged in or not. Get_logged_in function will actually check the value of the cookie to determine if the person is logged in.
# Board with the same name can be created for now. We have not added a check to see if the board with the same name already exists.
